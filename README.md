# DT Screening - Todo List

## Overview

This project is a simple to-do list application that allows users to:

- Add tasks with a title and an optional description
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete
- Delete tasks from the list
- View tasks in a dynamic task card layout
- Interact with a modal form to manage tasks

## How I Tackled the Task

I began this project at **4:30 PM** and completed it by **7:48 PM**. My approach was to break the functionality down into smaller, manageable pieces. I first focused on getting the structure and layout in place, then gradually worked on JavaScript to handle task creation, rendering, completion toggling, and deletion. After setting up the main functionality, I connected the form and modal and added event listeners to handle user input and modal interactions.

## Challenges and Time Constraints

I was not able to finish the project within the intended 2-hour timeframe. The main difficulties I encountered were:

- **Styling Adjustments**: I spent more time than expected adjusting the layout and styles to make the UI user-friendly and visually appealing.
- **Handling Input Values**: I initially faced issues with correctly retrieving input values and dynamically displaying them on the page, especially when working with the modal.

Despite these challenges, I managed to complete all the core features and ensured that the app functions as expected.
